      <h1>
            <h2> My hobby is doing a Korean martial-art called Tae-Kwon-Do. I do get hurt a lot, but it is still fun. I am now a second-degree black belt right now and I'm about to get third-degree. I like all the forms I have to memorize, but I like spharing even more. You might think it is similar to wretsling, but it is a completely diffrent game. You have to kick your partner's head,chest, or back to get points. The reason I like this game is that you can get rid of all your stress that you get from school,siblings, and more! As I said in the begenning I do get hurt a lot, but it is worth it to have fun. </section> </body>
